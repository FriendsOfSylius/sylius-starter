The pages of this documentation live in the `docs/` folder of the monorepo. The website that publishes them on
[sylius-starter.github.io/docs](https://sylius-starter.github.io/docs/) is built from the
[sylius-starter/docs](https://github.com/sylius-starter/docs) repository with Astro Starlight.

Clone that repository next to the monorepo, then serve the pages of your checkout:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sylius-starter/docs.git ../docs
castor docs:up               # http://localhost:4321/docs/, follows the changes of docs/
castor docs:up --port=4322   # on another port
castor docs:stop
```

`castor docs:up` installs the website dependencies on the first run and starts its dev server in the background. It
serves the `docs/` of the checkout it runs from: run it from a [worktree](worktrees.md) to preview the pages of its
branch. Only one server runs at a time, so it replaces any server started from another checkout. Set `DOCS_SITE_DIR`
when the website is cloned elsewhere.
