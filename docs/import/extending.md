The import only adds the catalog, its channel and a demo customer: it does not change your database schema. A project
needing more (e.g. a sales kit giving each demo shop its own admin) registers an import extension from its `castor.php`:

```php
<?php

use SyliusStarter\Core\App;
use SyliusStarter\Import\Extension\ImportExtensionInterface;
use SyliusStarter\Import\Extension\ImportExtensions;

ImportExtensions::register('demo_admins', new class implements ImportExtensionInterface {
    public function scaffold(App $app): void
    {
        // Copy your own templates into the Sylius app, patch entities, run migrations…
    }

    public function buildFixtures(string $projectSlug, array $target): array
    {
        // Written to config/sylius/fixtures/import/{slug}/extensions/{name}.php, loaded after the catalog.
        return ['demo_admin' => ['sylius_fixtures' => ['suites' => ['import' => ['fixtures' => [/* … */]]]]]];
    }

    public function describeShop(string $projectSlug, ?array $config): array
    {
        // Extra fields of the shop in `castor sylius:import:list`.
        return [];
    }
});
```

| Hook             | Called when                                                                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `scaffold`       | each import task makes sure the import scaffold is in the Sylius app                       |
| `buildFixtures`  | `sylius:import:fixtures:generate` writes the project's fixtures (`$target`: `channel`, `subdomain`, `shared`) |
| `describeShop`   | `sylius:import:list` lists the shops (`$config` is the project's `project.yaml`)           |

Keys you add to `project.yaml` are kept when the import rewrites it. To remove what you attached to an imported shop,
listen to the `import.channel_reset` Symfony event in the Sylius app, dispatched by `sylius:import:channel:reset`
(on `fixtures:load` and `sylius:import:delete`) with the channel code as subject and the `prefix` and `keep_channel`
arguments.

## Progress of the long steps

Generating or downloading images takes a while, and a tool running the tasks in the background (castor-api) only gets
their output once they finish. The image steps of `sylius:import:dataset:build`, `sylius:import:dataset:images` and
`sylius:import:fixtures:generate` therefore write their progress to `.castor/import/var/.progress/<key>.json`, where
the key is `dataset-<dataset slug>` or `shop-<project slug>`:

```json
{"label": "Product images", "done": 3, "total": 18, "current": "Baguette fraîche", "updatedAt": 1792744000}
```

`current` is the item being processed. The file is removed when the step ends. A task locks its shop or dataset, so a
key has a single writer at a time. Report the progress of your own steps with `import_progress_start()`,
`import_progress_current()`, `import_progress_advance()` and `import_progress_finish()`.
